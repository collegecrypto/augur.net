		<h3>What does Truthcoin aim to accomplish?</h3>
		<p>Traditional PMs have many problems:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Counterparty risk (must trust whoever is holding the money to use it as promised). CR is why one can't make bets with certain friends.</li>
			<li>The trustworthy PM-administrator must (coincidentally) share your taste in PM topics.</li>
			<li>The PM-administrator would have to be expected to provide service for a length of time (and not be interrupted by an executive's death or regulatory interference).</li>
			<li>PM-administrator would have to offer competitive prices, be economically viable, not go out of business, etc.
This project aims to solve all of these problems.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Truthcoin aims to solve all of these problems.</p>
