      <p>What is Augur?</p>

      <p>Augur is a decentralized open source platform for prediction markets, built on Bitcoin Core. It will fundamentally change the cost of information, its availability, and the ways in which people wager on future events.</p>

      <p> Why a prediction market?</p>

      <p>Since the beginning of civilization, human beings have been trying to predict tomorrow. The man that knows what tomorrow holds, can be king today. In a prediction market, this knowledge of the future is commoditized, and ultimately, monetized. A prediction market is more than a market for knowledge of the future - it&rsquo;s a market for accurate information in the present. The better the forecast, the greater the profit. This makes prediction markets the ideal model for information validation and dissemination. </p>

      <p> Why a decentralized prediction market?</p>

      <p>Prediction markets exist - there are any number of Bitcoin denominated prediction markets on the internet. Prediction markets have existed, and even achieved a modicum of mainstream success. InTrade in particular was famous for its accuracy in political elections. Yet InTrade, and the current Bitcoin denominated iterations all suffer from the same potentially lethal flaw: Centralization.</p>

      <p>InTrade had a single point of failure, and it failed. The US government made sure of it. Any controversial marketplace with a single point of failure will fail eventually (see: Silk Road). The only way to safeguard against this is to design an unstoppable marketplace which houses unstoppable markets. Augur will be an unstoppable marketplace for knowledge of the future. By building the first truly decentralized market for predictions, we can ensure that no entity will be able to tamper with the free flow of knowledge and its rewards, no matter how great their motivation.</p>

      <p> Why build Augur on Bitcoin Core?</p>

      <p>Bitcoin is a battle tested technology. When a technology represents billions of dollars of assets it becomes a target. Since Bitcoin first achieved mainstream success, it has been a target for many people who would love to break the system. Despite this bullseye on its back, minor issues early on notwithstanding, Bitcoin Core code has stood the test of time. By basing Augur on this tested foundation, we can say with confidence that the platform will be both secure and robust.</p>

      <p> Is this really possible? Will it even work?</p>

      <p>Yes, and yes. We have assembled a diverse group of individuals uniquely qualified to take on a task of this magnitude. Everybody working on this project has an intimate familiarity with Bitcoin Core, and the potential difficulties involved in building a platform this revolutionary. We have foremost experts in all relevant fields (crypto-currency, prediction markets, game theory) directly advising the project. </p>

      <p>Our closed alpha prototype is being readied for imminent release, and many team members have already made major contributions to the crypto-currency space (basiccoin, Slasher, Sidecoin, Jack add your releases here and other shit I&rsquo;m missing, same for Joey). If you would like to contribute to this project, please do not hesitate to contact a member of the team for more information.</p>

      <p>This sounds familiar - where have I heard of this idea before?</p>

      <p>The Augur project is based on the brilliant work of Paul Storzc at http://www.truthcoin.org. The Truthcoin white paper, and accompanying writings laid the groundwork for this project. While Augur is built on the foundation that Paul constructed with Truthcoin, there are technical differences and ongoing changes being made in the actual implementation. We are proud to call Paul a friend and look forward to continuing to work with him to refine the prototype, as we move closer to a finished product. </p>
