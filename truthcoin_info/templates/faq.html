		<h2>FAQ</h2>

		<h3>What does Truthcoin aim to accomplish?</h3>
		<p>Traditional PMs have many problems:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Counterparty risk (must trust whoever is holding the money to use it as promised). CR is why one can't make bets with certain friends.</li>
			<li>The trustworthy PM-administrator must (coincidentally) share your taste in PM topics.</li>
			<li>The PM-administrator would have to be expected to provide service for a length of time (and not be interrupted by an executive's death or regulatory interference).</li>
			<li>PM-administrator would have to offer competitive prices, be economically viable, not go out of business, etc.
This project aims to solve all of these problems.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Truthcoin aims to solve all of these problems.</p>

		<h3>Can't PMs be driven by people who are oblivious to how little they know?</h3>
		<p>Yes, at first. However, these people will quickly start losing large quantities of money, and thereby lose their ability to influence the market. Moreover, the existence of these ignorant "sheep" will attract "wolves" who profit by correcting the mistakes of the sheep.</p>

		<h3>How do you address the problem of low liquidity?</h3>
		<p>For PMs which are bounded, it is possible to design them such that traders can always update the market price, by trading with an automated market maker powered by a market scoring rule. http://hanson.gmu.edu/mktscore.pdf I threw together an Excel sheet in the docs folder LogMSR_Demo.xlsx for additional clarification. Feedback is appreciated.</p>

		<h3>Most people/organizations aren’t interested in improving their forecast accuracy through PMs. Who would pay to create (let alone subsidize) these markets?</h3>
		<p>Excellent question. Firstly, Authors (who bear the economic cost of Market-Creation) are rewarded with a slice of transaction volume. Recreational speculation is likely in markets covering sports and politics, arbitrage transactions are likely in markets tracking a price index, and in many cases, individuals will just disagree with each other passionately enough to begin wagering (global warming, gun control, etc.).</p>
		<p>Secondly, the public might just pay for publically useful information.</p>
		<p>Thirdly, although the information revealed by a PM is public, the effect of that revelation may be privately beneficial. For example, consider Robin Hanson’s Wish, where conditional PMs are introduced to advise firing an incompetent yet entrenched CEO. With 1000 USD per firm to kickstart this idea, we might then collect data on firm/BoD/investor response. However, if we did not have 1000 USD per firm ourselves (we don’t), is there not someone who would benefit from the creation of this information? Of course there is: the second-in-line for CEO! CEOs are typically paid so much that their salary can be twice that of even the CFO. 1000 bucks is nothing for a decent shot at such a nice raise, to say nothing of the competitive spirit which overwhelms those who seek the top job. Even better, individuals would not try this if they suspected their CEO of actually being quite competent. So there is actually an economically-efficient self-selection in the creation of these markets: when unneeded, they are not created. Better still, competent CEOs may themselves create these markets to protect their job (although I doubt this type of activity will happen for some time).<p>
		<p>Fourth, individuals could collaborate via assurance contract to efficiently pool their info-demand. In fact, in my applications paper, I describe a way of using PMs to create extremely incentive-powerful Trustless Dominant Assurance Contracts. To my knowledge nothing similar has ever been conceived.</p>
